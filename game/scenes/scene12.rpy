"After spending time with Stacey and Moe, I ended up feeling pretty... relaxed!"
"Relaxed enough to actually get some homework out of the way. Or, at least, in-class work I had to skimp out on."
"Yeaaah, that still life assignment in Mrs Bernardinelli's class didn't up and disappear... and she definitely had questions for me about it too over email."
"I had to come up with an excuse, but she seemed pretty cool with it... so long as I did my work at the end of the day. So long as I got this done and in to her tomorrow, I'd be back where I'm supposed to be!"
"And Kamika was out of the room for now as well. Part of me hoped she had some night class to deal with..."
"...Or maybe she found some fling to spend the night with. Hell, that'd be even better. A night of peace and quiet wouldn't be all that bad..."
