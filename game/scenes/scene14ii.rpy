"Lucca and I make our way back towards the plaza, since it's actually pretty empty at this time of day."

"As we're walking, I note quietly that there's no sign of the sound equipment that Kamika left behind after yesterday's incident."

"It seems unlikely to me that she returned to the scene to collect it, so it's either in a lost-and-found right now or enterprising students got a bunch of free stuff."

"I don't even realize the memory of yesterday's hijinks has my face twisted all up into a frown until Lucca shoots me a concerned look."
