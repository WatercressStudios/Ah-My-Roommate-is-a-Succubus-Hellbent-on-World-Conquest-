"Soon enough, I found myself back outside my dorm room."
"But it was strange... I've never felt {i}this{/i} exhausted after art history class."
"It's supposed to be an easy credit, yeah? Mr. Deeks really needs to calm down about this stuff..."
"Not just that, but I felt like I had all eyes on me... It was probably that transfer student."
"Eyeing me up like I'm some kind of T-bone steak... If she's got time to stare at me, then she could at least mind her business and pay attention to the lecture!"
"...Whatever. It's not like thinking about it too hard is gonna make it any better. Besides, I can't be thinking about that when I have anatomy homework to deal with before next class."
"I put my key into the lock, turn it, and enter my room."

#scene dormroom

"As far as dorm rooms go, it's a pretty alright one."
"I had requested the use of a single person dorm, when most of the dorms at this school are for two, or even four."
"It's not that I don't like being around others; I'd just like as little distractions as possible, especially when I'm still getting used to this country..."
"I put my bag on the sofa and was about to head into the bedroom, when..."

yum "...Huh?"

"...Something smells strange all of a sudden."
"I can't tell if it's pleasant or revolting... is it coming from here?"
"...No, couldn't be. I make absolutely sure to throw out my trash. It must be coming from someone else's room."

"I mutter to myself. Whatever it was, it was invasive."
"They could at least be more considerate of the other people in these dorms... If it keeps being a problem, I'll just let the RA know."

"Shrugging it off as nothing, I enter my room to prepare myself for school work..."
"And that's when... I found her."
