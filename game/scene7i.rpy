"It's as I'm heading back up to the dorms that I recognize a certain ridiculous cowboy hat furtively sneaking into the distance."

"Yep, that's Lucca alright, though I don't know where she's going with that heavy backpack. I don't think I've seen her bring it to class, and there aren't any classroom buildings in that direction, anyway."

"Come to think of it, I just don't know what's in that direction, period."

"...Okay, screw it, I'm curious."

"If nothing else, I should probably talk to Lucca about the disappointing experience I had calling Satan."

"Making my way down the sidewalk, I notice that the road wends into the trees, creating a canopy-like effect. After I've been walking for a minute or two, I realize that that's all I can see anymore."

"Nothing but trees, and a road that seems to get more poorly-maintained the further I walk along it."

"It's vaguely spooky... but, somehow, knowing I'm following a {i}demon{/i} into it just makes the moment feel farcical."

"I guess after all the time I've spent around demons, I automatically regard anything to do with them as fundamentally ridiculous..."

"Though Lucca is too far ahead of me for me to see, this road only goes the one way, so unless she decided to break off and vanish into the woods, I don't think I've lost her."

"I don't think she's the type to do that sort of thing, at any rate."

"Only a few minutes of walking later, the trees part, and in the clearing, I see something I never would have expected to see:"

"...Dorms."

"Yep, these buildings are definitely student housing... though I've never heard of them."

"The metal railing and scaffolding leading to the second floor is totally rusted over, and the concrete stairways are literally crumbling - there's literally piles of rocky debris at the bottom of the steps, the way upstairs blocked off by construction tape."

"Around them, the grass around them is totally unmowed, the tall underbrush threatened to encroach into the covered walkways. It's like a tableau of growth and decay."

"I guess these buildings have been... decommissioned, or condemned. Clearly, nobody's lived in this ghost town for a while."

"Well, except for the various deer I can see grazing off in the distance. I guess they like this place, since it's so quiet and undisturbed."

"Maybe this is where Kamika was squatting before she decided to invade my living space..."

##sfx: Sound of an aerosol can

"Is that... spray paint I hear?"

"Amidst the yawning emptiness of the housing complex, the sound carries as if it was right next to me. It seems to be coming from around the nearest building."

"Is that Lucca? What's she doing?"

"Leaving the sidewalk, I trudge into the tall, neglected grass to investigate, mentally praying that I don't wind up with any tick bites. Lyme disease is terrifying."

"Sure enough, along the side of the building that faces away from the road, Lucca's there, brandishing a purple can of spray paint."
