"For some reason, today's classes go by lightning fast."
"It's probably because I had my mind focused on Kamika the whole time, because the material we went over has been nothing but a blur to me."
"Damn it all, even when she's not in my presence, she somehow finds a way to interfere with my life! I just want this day to be done with as quickly as possible..."
"Thankfully, I only have one morning class to worry about today, and as soon as it's over, I trot out to the plaza to look for Kamika."
"To her credit, it doesn't take long for me to find her at all - probably because she starts screaming my name and waving to me as soon as she sees me."
"Sighing, I make my way to her like a lost soul finding its way to the Gates of Hell."
"...And now I feel a sudden urge to punch my brother on the shoulder for even thinking that. God damn it, I cannot catch a break lately..."
