"I watch Stacey and Moe head off together. Now it was just Lucca and myself."
"Silence hung heavy in the air. Nobody wanted to make the first move."

luc "...W-well... I guess the party left quite a mess in there, huh?"

voice "c-17ii-2.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "I could... I could help with some of the cleanup. I-I had to clean up after my sisters all of the time, eheh... heh..."

voice "c-17ii-3.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "...I think we can leave clean-up detail for the morning..."

voice "c-17ii-4.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "O-oh... okay."

"The small talk didn't last long, and silence hung over the two of us once more. Lucca was fidgeting to herself, stifled by the deafening quiet."

voice "c-17ii-5.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "...S-so, Yumi, can I... may I speak with you? Alone?"

voice "c-17ii-6.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "You, uh, sure it's a good idea to leave her alone like this?"

voice "c-17ii-7.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "I-it'll be fine. She tends to get a little, ah, broody? When things don't go her way..."

voice "c-17ii-8.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "...L-let's go for a walk! There's... stuff we should probably go over."

voice "c-17ii-9.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Um, okay. But the walls are actually, like, super thick, so..."

voice "c-17ii-10.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Oh?? ...E-even then."

voice "c-17ii-11.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "...Mm. Alright. Where'd you want to go, anyway?"

voice "c-17ii-12.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Ah... you just wanna walk around campus for a bit? It's a nice night out..."

voice "c-17ii-13.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "That sounds, uh, nice, but... did you bring your hat?"

voice "c-17ii-14.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "...Eh?"

voice "c-17ii-15.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "I mean, if someone saw the horn. We'll probably run into people, even at night, sooo..."

voice "c-17ii-16.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Oh, oh yes, you... you're right. I-I got it in my bag here..."

"With a hasty flourish, she pulled it out and affixed it. She smiled brightly..."

"...Though it had faded in short order."

voice "c-17ii-17.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "I'd gotten so used to not having to hide that part of myself... oh well."

voice "c-17ii-18.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "...Sorry, I... o-okay, let's go."

"I'm not sure why Lucca's insistent on going for a walk at this hour, with everything that's happened, but I'm not left with many options otherwise."

"With a shrug, I decide to go with it."

"As one would expect, there weren't a ton of people outdoors. There was the odd straggler running between buildings. Maybe they were on a crunch."

"Lucca's eyes wandered from building to building. They tended to linger on the odd outdoor exhibit on the campus, but not for long."

voice "c-17ii-19.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Y'know... whenever I need a moment of quiet, I like to come outside by myself."

voice "c-17ii-20.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Mm. It's pretty relaxed when there aren't a billion students futzing about."

voice "c-17ii-21.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "...Christ, I'm gonna turn into a pretentious loner, aren't I? Living on top of a mountain, probably..."

voice "c-17ii-22.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Th-that's not... probable! Artists like their isolation, but..."

voice "c-17ii-23.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "...C'mon, let's take a seat over here."

"Lucca pointed out a circle of outdoor seating out on grounds. They were unoccupied, arranged in a circle, and surrounded by other art pieces."

"With a nod, I accept Lucca's offer, and take a seat."

voice "c-17ii-24.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "...Of course, you're the sort to slow down and smell the roses a bit, Lucca."

voice "c-17ii-25.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Haha... Guilty as charged!~"

voice "c-17ii-26.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Heh. I'm too busy rushing to classes. Or the cafeteria. Or the bus..."

voice "c-17ii-27.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Aw, that's a shame."

voice "c-17ii-28.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Yeah yeah, really bad habit... I could at least slow down a bit for inspiration."

voice "c-17ii-29.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Mmhm. W-well, not just inspiration, but..."


#cg lucca

"Lucca looked across the grounds, over to a selection of murals canvassing the grounds."

"She had a serene, peaceful look to her face... but the crease of her nose wrinkled as she stared with a serious, contemplative stare."

voice "c-17ii-30.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "...What kind of story do you wanna tell with your art?"

voice "c-17ii-31.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Mm? Me? Uh..."

"Lucca was putting me a little on the spot here. Still, she sounded serious. I wanted to give it actual thought."

voice "c-17ii-32.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Hm. Lemme think..."

voice "c-17ii-33.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "...I like the idea of capturing beauty in a moment. Like, a photo can capture the moment, as it appears, but..."

voice "c-17ii-34.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Unless you're a professional, it's... limited? You lose some of the emotion just underneath, the feelings of the creator."

voice "c-17ii-35.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "...It's a little late, so I'm not sure how good that sounds, just... I like capturing more than the moment. And preserving it, emotionally."

voice "c-17ii-36.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Hm. That's a good answer. An honest answer."

voice "c-17ii-37.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Me, I... I think a lot of artists have some kind of yearning in their work. To leave something behind, to make a mark, or resonate with someone else."

voice "c-17ii-38.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Looking at art, I can... I can feel that intent. I think it's beautiful, and... m-maybe a little enviable."

voice "c-17ii-39.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "I kinda wanna make that kind of impact, someday. I just second-guess myself so much along the way, so I... I stumble."

voice "c-17ii-40.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "...You think you're going to stick with graffiti, Lucca?"

voice "c-17ii-41.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Hm... maybe. It's like..."

voice "c-17ii-42.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "It's like a big shout to the world, that I'm here. And I'm gonna make my mark."

voice "c-17ii-43.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "...A-and it's got a little spice of danger to it. It's wrong, but it feels right, y'know?"

voice "c-17ii-44.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Heh. You're a little imp, y'know?"

voice "c-17ii-45.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "A-ah... not an imp specifically, but... but I see your point."

voice "c-17ii-46.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "...Still, I wouldn't apologize for it."

voice "c-17ii-47.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "It's good to have a passion. I'm happy you're figuring that out."

voice "c-17ii-48.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "I don't think I could do graffiti. I get too attached to my art, and they could go and paint it over..."

voice "c-17ii-49.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Hm... well, I could live with that. So long as a few people got to see it."

voice "c-17ii-50.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "The fun's in the performance itself, right?"

voice "c-17ii-51.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Heh. You don't wanna make a masterpiece that'll stick around long after you're gone?"

voice "c-17ii-52.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Ah... I dunno. Chasing an opus is... a dangerous idea. I just wanna create, day to day."

voice "c-17ii-53.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "...Wow."

voice "c-17ii-54.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "...D-did I say something weird? I-I'm sorry, I kinda... went on a tangent."

voice "c-17ii-55.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "N-no, not at all, you were just... really cool, right now."

voice "c-17ii-56.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Cool??"

voice "c-17ii-57.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Yeah. Inspiring even."

voice "c-17ii-58.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Heh. I'm glad we get to be partners. We're gonna kick ass, right?"

voice "c-17ii-59.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Yeah, we'll kick... kick some good ass, heheh..."

"She was laughing through blush cheeks. I couldn't help but smile with her."

"We stayed like that for a bit, quietly enjoying our surroundings."

luc "Ahh... I forgot, I owed you an explanation for... everything."

voice "c-17ii-72.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "...Jeez, though, where do I even start?"

"Lucca rubbed the back of her neck. She seemed to be thinking on her words carefully."

voice "c-17ii-73.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "...Well... S-Tan put together our idol troupe a while ago. A-and Kamika used to be part of it, too."

voice "c-17ii-74.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Yeah, Moe mentioned something like that. Actually, now that you mention it..."

voice "c-17ii-75.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "I think I heard her singing in the shower every now and then."

voice "c-17ii-76.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "And there was the whole live performance spectacle on campus..."

voice "c-17ii-77.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Mmhm. She was jealous of S-Tan's popularity, and Kamika... felt like she wasn't getting the respect she deserved."

voice "c-17ii-78.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "So she split from the group. S-Tan found a replacement for her, but... Kamika was always pretty moody about these sorts of things."

voice "c-17ii-79.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "I-I didn't really wanna get involved, but... S-Tan gave me a heads up, and I was in the area, so..."

voice "c-17ii-80.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Whoa, you're telling me S-Tan actually sent someone? I thought it was just hot air!"

voice "c-17ii-81.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Heheh, y-you'd be surprised... sh-she didn't really, 'send me', per se."

voice "c-17ii-82.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "I doubt I would've been S-Tan's first choice anyway. Nobody really... listens to what I have to say, even if I'm one of the older ones..."

voice "c-17ii-83.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "I never really had, um... stage presence? Not like the others, eheh..."

voice "c-17ii-84.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Well, hey, you stood up to Kamika during her show, right? That took more guts!"

voice "c-17ii-85.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Ahh, I guess? I dunno, I just... did what anyone would've."

voice "c-17ii-86.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "A-and I don't think it made much difference. Kamika just went up and did something even more... s-stupid."

voice "c-17ii-87.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Eh, she's stubborn. Don't take it personally, we had our own share of shouting matches..."

voice "c-17ii-88.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Still, though. 'Invoking world domination' is a bit of a dramatic upswing from a band breakup."

voice "c-17ii-89.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Mmhm... Kamika's always been a bit of a... a drama queen."

voice "c-17ii-90.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
