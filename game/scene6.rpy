"Hastily, I glide out through the dorm corridor, weaving around the other students just milling outside their doors lazily, like children sitting on a stoop."

"A couple of them turn to peer at me with a sluggish sort of annoyance as I hurry past them to the central elevators, as though my urgency was ruining the vibe."

"Sorry for the inconvenience, guys. It's not like I'm out here trying to figure out how to {i}purge a demon{/i} from our {i}shared living space{/i} or anything."

"Because {i}that{/i} would, of course, be absolutely ridiculous... for it to inexplicably be freshman art student {i}Yumi Takaya's{/i} sole responsibility to handle any unsolicited demonic infestations?"

"Surely, it would be the height of injustice, to burden a poor, hard-working girl like her with something so utterly {i}stupid.{/i}"

"...I kind of want to scream at the top of my lungs right now, but in a building with this many people, the only way I'd get away with it is by doing it into a bathtub full of water."

"We'll see how I feel in a few hours, I guess."

"Making it to the elevators, I push the call button... and then hammer it a couple more times, just for good measure."

"The elevator takes infuriatingly long to arrive, particularly given that there aren't that many floors in this building, but eventually it reaches my floor with a droll little chime and I slip between the parting doors."

"I take it all the way down to the lobby, blow past the tired upperclassman studying at the reception desk, and loop all the way back around the building to an unphotogenic alcove concealing a bunch of overstuffed dumpsters."

"Good grief, do American college students generate a lot of garbage. "

"Still, nobody will see or eavesdrop on me here, which is good... I'll die before I let anyone witness what I'm about to do."


"...I'm about to given Satan a phone call."

"I already know I don't; It's not as though I've ever had any reason to call the Demon of Wrath before."

"My brother would have it, probably. I could text him - even though it's like three in the morning back in Japan. But how am I going to explain to him why I need it?"

"But then I realize I'm completely fooling myself: it's {i}Satan{/i}."
