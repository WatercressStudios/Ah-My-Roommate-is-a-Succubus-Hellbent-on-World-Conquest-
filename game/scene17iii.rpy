"Moe departs, heading back to his room. Good luck dealing with that mob - although, I guess they are... zombified."

"Gross."

"Alright, I need a break from Kamika."

voice "c-17iii-2.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Y-yes!"

voice "c-17iii-3.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "I really hate to ask this of you, but could you keep an eye on Kamika for me? I need some air."

voice "c-17iii-4.wav" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "O-of course! Anything you need..."

"I feel really bad, but I need some time away right now."

"Lucca smiles halfheartedly at me once more, then enters my dorm room."

"I turn to Stacey."

voice "c-17iii-5.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Hey, want to take a walk?"

voice "c-17iii-6.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "You're not going to take me to the cafe 'to do work' again, are you?"

voice "c-17iii-7.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Didn't you {i}just{/i} say that you needed to do homework?"

voice "c-17iii-8.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Just because I have homework to do doesn't mean I'm gonna do it."

voice "c-17iii-9.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "I-what? Okay, let's just go on a walk."

voice "c-17iii-10.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Whatever you say."

"I don't even know where I'm going. I guess I just need to let off some steam, physically."

"Thankfully, Stacey seems fine with walking quietly. She's pretty go-with-the-flow like that."

voice "c-17iii-11.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "So..."

voice "c-17iii-12.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "So?"

voice "c-17iii-13.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "So, why art?"

voice "c-17iii-14.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Why art? Why this question?"

voice "c-17iii-15.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "I dunno, you seemed kinda lost, so I figured I'd chat with ya."

voice "c-17iii-16.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "...Okay."

voice "c-17iii-17.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Like, why do you do what you do? Everyone's gotta have a purpose for that shit, ya know? Art's tedious as hell, I don't think I could ever do it."

voice "c-17iii-18.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "I could ask you the same for your script writing."

voice "c-17iii-19.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "I asked you."

voice "c-17iii-20.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "No, you first."

"Stacey just shrugs, and goes with it."

voice "c-17iii-21.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "I think we discussed it before, but it's a way of expressing myself."

voice "c-17iii-22.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Expressing yourself? I guess even you need to."

voice "c-17iii-23.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "I know, surprising right?"

voice "c-17iii-24.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "It gives me the opportunity to take things at my own pace. Kinda like how I take life one step at a time, I can do the same with writing."

voice "c-17iii-25.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "I can always take a break from writing. Ya know, write some shit and push it aside and revisit it later."

voice "c-17iii-26.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Sometimes you can't do that in life, and you're forced to make decisions that you don't want to."

voice "c-17iii-27.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Writing isn't like that. I can do whatever the hell I want and still feel somewhat satisfied."


voice "c-17iii-28.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Plus, you can make bank writing sex shit, ya know?"

voice "c-17iii-29.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Nothing's ever sacred to you."

voice "c-17iii-30.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "It's a good fallback."

voice "c-17iii-31.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "I also get to put into words my own message that I want to tell people. I'm not that great with words in real life, but on paper? I can spend years perfecting whatever the hell I wanna say."

voice "c-17iii-32.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "It's a tangible thing that you don't really get in other forms, ya know? Like, you can only say so much with a picture - at the end of the day, pictures and art only get you so far."

voice "c-17iii-33.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Sure, emotions are cool n' shit, but writing is like an injection of meaning. You get it immediately, and you get it directly."

voice "c-17iii-34.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "It's that good shit. Hashtag blazeit."

voice "c-17iii-35.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "...Right. I can see that, yeah. I can agree with wanting to live things in the moment. Art is like, say, capturing that one moment in time."

voice "c-17iii-36.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "If writing is living life one step at a time, art is capturing the feeling of each step."

voice "c-17iii-37.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "And hentai can earn you so, {i}so{/i} much money."

voice "c-17iii-38.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Well yeah, but-"

voice "c-17iii-39.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "I keep telling you, you'll cave one day. The gravy train is too good to pass up."

voice "c-17iii-40.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "I'm a saint, thank you very much."

voice "c-17iii-41.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Chugga-Chugga-Chugga."

voice "c-17iii-42.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Hey, I'm being honest!"

voice "c-17iii-43.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Not with yourself."

voice "c-17iii-44.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Ugh! I thought we were having a {i}moment{/i}."

voice "c-17iii-45.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "That's some weak shit, Yumi."

voice "c-17iii-46.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "It's meaningful, okay?"

voice "c-17iii-47.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Weak."
extend sta "Shit."

"I laugh it off at her, shaking my head. I'm not so quick to sacrifice my own morals, thank you very much."

voice "c-17iii-48.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Well, I have a question for you, now."

voice "c-17iii-49.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Shoot."

voice "c-17iii-50.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Why'd you {i}really{/i} summon Moe?"

voice "c-17iii-51.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Hmm?"

voice "c-17iii-52.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "After hearing you get all sentimental about writing, I find it hard to believe that you put in all the work to summon a demon just because you were bored, Stacey."

voice "c-17iii-53.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "I wasn't lying okay?"

voice "c-17iii-54.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Well, okay, I'll give that to you, but being bored wasn't the {i}only{/i} reason, was it?"

voice "c-17iii-55.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "I was lonely."

voice "c-17iii-56.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "You can tell me anyth-wait what."

voice "c-17iii-57.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Yeah. I was lonely, so I figured I'd summon a friend."

"Wow, that was a lot easier than I expected it to be."

voice "c-17iii-58.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "So, one, that's really sad, and two, you expected it to be easier to {i}summon an honest to god demon{/i} than go out and make some friends?"

voice "c-17iii-59.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Yep."

voice "c-17iii-60.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Just like that?"

voice "c-17iii-61.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Just like that."

voice "c-17iii-62.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Hey, man, I'm writing a story about a kid who fantasizes about summoning demons. Didya really think that was all from my imagination?"

voice "c-17iii-63.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Dude, I've been that lonely kid. I wanted to write a story proving that it doesn't always work."

voice "c-17iii-64.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "That you have to be hella serious about that shit to actually go through with it. You can't just live in your own head all day. That's just a waste."

voice "c-17iii-65.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Yeah, I was that lonely kid who thought myself only capable of making friends with the weirdest shit."

voice "c-17iii-66.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "It worked out real well, though. Moe's pretty cool, and while I'm not the most graceful kid out there, I'm not so awfully awkward and just... {i}weird{/i}."

voice "c-17iii-67.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Well, you're a little weird."

voice "c-17iii-68.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "There's a failed demon of lust in your room literally {i}right now{/i}."

voice "c-17iii-69.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Touche."

voice "c-17iii-70.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "I was weird. Kids didn't like me. I was bullied a lot, and like so many others in my situation, I retreated into the occult to fulfill my fantasies."

voice "c-17iii-71.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "I was never one for world domination, and I wasn't even really big on revenge fantasies either."

voice "c-17iii-72.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Having just one friend was good enough for me."

"Holy, that's so sad."
#Alexa play despacito
"I wonder if my brother was the same way?"

voice "c-17iii-73.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "I know Moe can be a little caustic at times, but he was the perfect fit. He even got me into writing, with the help of S-Tan."

voice "c-17iii-74.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "I guess that's why you two get along so well. I can't say I'm jealous, but it's pretty cool nonetheless."

voice "c-17iii-75.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Yeah. I'm surprised he sticks around, to be honest."

voice "c-17iii-76.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "You think he likes you?"

"Stacey coughs loudly, covering her chest with her hand."

voice "c-17iii-77.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "I didn't want {i}that{/i} kind of friend, Yumi."

voice "c-17iii-78.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Not even a little?"

voice "c-17iii-79.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Well, maybe a little, but that's besides the point. Nah, we're chill. It is odd that they're so nice, though."

voice "c-17iii-80.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Have you ever wondered why demons like helping out humans so much?"

voice "c-17iii-81.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "They're sweethearts, that's why. They get a bad rap."

voice "c-17iii-82.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Yeah, I guess so."

"We keep walking silently, enjoying the fresh air. It's pretty cool to have someone to confide in, knowing that you won't be judged too hard."

"I hope I've been that person for Stacey, and that I can continue being so in the future."

"There's a sort of carefree atmosphere that follows Stacey around, and it feels... nice."

"It's like the opposite of my brother."

"The silence is broken when my phone rings. I check it and sigh when I see the ID."

voice "c-17iii-83.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Sinful Stars..."

voice "c-17iii-84.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Oh shit, it's S-Tan. Put her on speaker. It'll be nice to talk to her again."

voice "c-17iii-85.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Wait, you guys talk often?"

voice "c-17iii-86.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Yeah, we keep in contact."

"Well, okay..."

"I answer the phone, wholley expecting my ears to be blown out."

voice "c-17iii-87.wav" #S-Tan (Dani Chambers)
sat "Hiiiiii!~ Yumi, Yumi, I got some updates for you! Has Lucca caught up with you yet??"

voice "c-17iii-88.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "No, it's just Stacey and I."

voice "c-17iii-89.wav" #S-Tan (Dani Chambers)
sat "Staceyyy! How are you girl?? How's the script going? Everything at school been fantastic?"

voice "c-17iii-90.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)

voice "c-17iii-91.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Stories?"

voice "c-17iii-92.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Yeah. Did you think the script was one hundred percent an autobiography?"

voice "c-17iii-93.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Well, no, but..."

voice "c-17iii-94.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Yeah, hearing all about your brother helped me get the script together."

"I knew something was up! Isn't that, like, a breach of privacy? Should I be mad?"

voice "c-17iii-95.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Don't make fun of my brother! Only I can do that..."

voice "c-17iii-96.wav" #S-Tan (Dani Chambers)
sat "Aaaaanyywayys!~ I've had a good chat with our ex-Demon of Envy, and she says she'll stay out of trouble!"

voice "c-17iii-97.wav" #S-Tan (Dani Chambers)
sat "Isn't that great?"

voice "c-17iii-98.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "I'm calling bullshit."

voice "c-17iii-102.wav" #S-Tan (Dani Chambers)
sat "Welll, that's why I have you two! You'll keep an eye on her, right?~~"

"Something tells me that I don't exactly have a say in the matter."

voice "c-17iii-103.wav" #S-Tan (Dani Chambers)
sat "Anyways, I do owe you two an explanation. I'm sure you're, like, suuuuper confused."

voice "c-17iii-104.wav" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)

voice "c-17iii-108.wav" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "I heard from Moe."

"It makes sense - I think I've heard her sing in the shower every once in a while."

voice "c-17iii-109.wav" #S-Tan (Dani Chambers)
sat "Yeah! I had to find a replacement for her after she split, it was suuuch a headache!"

voice "c-17iii-110.wav" #S-Tan (Dani Chambers)
sat "Caused me so much more work. And she left on such bad terms! In the last week, she was sooo mean to everyone!!"

voice "c-17iii-111.wav" #S-Tan (Dani Chambers)
sat "But her shenanigans here were because of it. I tried to talk to her about it, believe me!"

voice "c-17iii-112.wav" #S-Tan (Dani Chambers)
sat "But she blocked me."

voice "c-17iii-113.wav" #S-Tan (Dani Chambers)
