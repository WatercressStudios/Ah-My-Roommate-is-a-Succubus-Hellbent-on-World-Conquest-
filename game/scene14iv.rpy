"I decide to leave that skank behind and work outside."
"And... for the first time in what feels like forever, I'm finally... alone."
"No Kamika pining for my attention."
"No Stacey getting into trouble."
"No Moe giving me backtalk."
"No Lucca to guilt me into anything."
"For once, I'm well and truly..."
"In paradise!"
"God, I can feel the freedom flowing through me! I start sketch, and my hand is like lightning!"
"To think, this is what I would've been capable of if I just didn't have all of them breathing down my neck all the time!"
"The seconds turn to minutes, the minutes to hours."
"Blooming trees, rustling leaves, blowing grass..."
"I can capture everything! It feels fantastic to just... be an artist again!"
"This is easily my best work. I feel unstoppable!"

yum "Yaaaaaaaaawn..."

"Unstoppable to anything but the end of the day, that is."
"Nice as my reprieve was, it's about time for me to get back to... Kamika."
"I sigh. It was good while it lasted."
"I head into the dorms and enter my room."
"But to my surprise and utter delight, she's gone! I can finally get a full night's sleep!"
"No. I can't be so sure."
"I feverishly check every possible hiding spot, just to make sure she's not waiting to pounce on me."
"But it's really true. She's gone. Gone!"
"I lock the door, just to make sure she doesn't come back. Part of me thinks she can just turn into a slug and crawl under the door or something, but I push the thought out of my head."

"I wake up, energized and raring to go. Without Kamika, I've finally gotten the energy I need."
"I feel like I can handle anything!"
"Anything but Kamika herself, of course. That harlot could tire out a caffeinated puppy."
"But enough about her. If I'm lucky, she's had enough of me and I'll be able to mind my studies for the rest of college!"
"I prepare for the day, and trot off to class with a skip in my step."
"This is so exciting! I feel almost like a whole new person. I can greet even a morning class like this with a smile!"

"I look at my e-mail. Class wasn't even canceled."

"And that's how my career as an artist began."
"I found modest success, and eventually bought myself a shack up in the mountains where I could finally be the hermit I was meant to be."
"Truly, my life is bliss."
